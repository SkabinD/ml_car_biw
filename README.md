# ml_car_biw
An attempt to use ML and DL methods to predict global stiffness and eigenfrequences of car body frame. Data set was generated by multiparamtric CAE-analysis.

Main goal is to train model that should approximate the original data set with sufficient accuracy. In this case, when changing the original design of the power frame of the car, no additional numerical calculations will be required to obtain the target characteristics.
